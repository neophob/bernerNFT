# BernerNFT

Based on https://github.com/fxhash/fxhash-simple-boilerplate

This repo is used as education repo to build simple, generative NFT for the FXHash website / community. It's called BernerNFT because that is a local meetup here in Bern/Switzerland that is called BernerJS Talks.

FXHash home is https://www.fxhash.xyz/u/B%C3%A4rnerJs

- [final](https://github.com/neophob/bernerNFT/tree/%231-final): add noise and edge detection so the result looks less synthetic

## #2: Geometrische Formen, Zweiter Teil

- [step 1](https://github.com/neophob/bernerNFT/tree/%232-step1): start, identical to the final "Geometrische Formen"
- [step 2](https://github.com/neophob/bernerNFT/tree/%232-step2): replace rectangles with circles
- [step 3](https://github.com/neophob/bernerNFT/tree/%232-step3): more colors, more interesting interpreation what the border is/should look like
